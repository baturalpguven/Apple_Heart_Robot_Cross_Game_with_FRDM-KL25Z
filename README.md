# Apple_Heart_Robot_Cross_Game_with_FRDM-KL25Z
The aim of this project is collect certain amount of points. This project a little bit advanced version of the Park_Sensor project. 

In the project, a keypad, LEDs, FRDM-kl25z, breadboard, LCD screen, HCSR04, stepper motor, and 8x8 LED matrix were used. The LED matrix generates random images, and when the player sees the images which are apple, heart, and robot, the cross act moves closer or further to the HCSR04 sensor. If the player fails to act according to the rules there are penalties. The program is written in C++ language on the MBED online environment.
